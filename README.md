# SpireScheduleBuilder
HackUMassV Nov 3 - 5 Project

To run it, open it in a python IDE and run FlaskTest.py. This will locally host it onto your web browser.

WARNING: You must add your own Spire ID and password in order for this to work. ALSO, it has very limited functionality. It can only parse data and return it. We did not have time to implement the schedule building algorithm.
